I started a thread in this forum and pointed a lack of \"Call\" action usable in button's action.\nHere is a complete explanation of the problem: http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?p=393761#p393761\n\nBasically:\n\n```\nscreen special_actions_screen():\n    window id \"special_actions_window\":\n        # place the window on the right of the screen\n        vbox:\n            # ...\n            button:\n                text \"Punch In The Face\"\n                action Jump(\"on_punch_1\") # OK, but never return!\n            button:\n                text \"Smile/Grin\"\n                action Call(\"on_smile_1\") # ERROR: Call is not defined\n```\n\nI need a Call action to be able to return from a label (see the thread for a full example of my use case) exactly like when you use the \"call\" statement.\n\nMy current \"hack\" (which seems to work is):\n\n```\n                action Function(Renpy.call, \"on_smile_1\") # Equivalent to \"call on_smile_1\"\n```\n\nHowever I suspect that this is not the intended way to use button's action property. Jump action don't allow me to return from a label as it is equivalent to a \"jump\" statement.\n\nTherefore I think that a Call action is missing (in the documentation too).\n\nI could provide a patch but I see several ways of doing this and I'm not familiar with this codebase so I might need guidance if there are hidden difficulties with this.\n\nAlso, I don't understand why this is not already available. Is there some complexities with this feature that I am not perceiving? Or maybe it have just been forgotten? I suspect that a lot of people would have needed to do this so I'm a bit lost as to why it's not already available.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/783","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/783/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/783/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/783/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/783","id":116899764,"number":783,"title":"Frame

fixes a bug where exposure events didn't properly redraw the window on X if a player's using software rendering.  (Observed on two separate Debian machines, one with a Radeon and an OLPC with a Geode; neither have proprietary drivers installed.)\n\nTo reproduce the bug:\nRENPY_RENDER=sw ./renpy.sh\nMove another window partially over the launcher\nmove the window back off\n\nThe contents of the other window will be stuck atop the Ren'Py window until Ren'Py actually redraws that section of the screen.\n\nThis pull req also adds support for home and end in text input fields, and widens the cursor to two pixels to work around a bug where one-pixel-wide input field cursors don't show up on software rendering.  (This was observed on both Debian and El Capitan)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/771","id":113149872,"number":771,"title":"An automatic backup crash on Windows system with non-ascii profile name.","user":{"login":"roxygen","id":3707285,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3707285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen","html_url":"https://github.com/roxygen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roxygen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-24T10:30:54Z","updated_at":"2015-10-24T14:46:24Z","closed_at":"2015-10-24T14:46:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can confirm that creating a profile with only ascii characters doesn't cause this problem.\nCurrent working profile path is \"C:\\Users\\Александр\\\".\nHere is the content of a traceback.txt\n\n```\nI'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.\n\nAfter initialization, but before game start.\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc0 in position 7: ordinal not in range(128)\n\n-- Full Traceback ------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull traceback:\n  File \"D:\\dev\\rpy\\renpy-6.99.6-sdk\\renpy\\bootstrap.py\", line 281, in bootstrap\n    renpy.main.main()\n  File \"D:\\dev\\rpy\\renpy-6.99.6-sdk\\renpy\\main.py\", line 442, in main\n    renpy.game.script.make_backups()\n  File \"D:\\dev\\rpy\\renpy-6.99.6-sdk\\renpy\\script.py\", line 174, in make_backups\n    backupdir = self.choose_backupdir()\n  File \"D:\\dev\\rpy\\renpy-6.99.6-sdk\\renpy\\script.py\", line 154, in choose_backupdir\n    backupdir = os.path.join(backups, basename)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\ntpath.py\", line 84, in join\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc0 in position 7: ordinal not in range(128)\n\nWindows-8-6.2.9200\nRen'Py 6.99.6.739\nTheWedding 0.0.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/770","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/770/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/770/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/770/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/770","id":113124632,"number":770,"title":"Movie loop's lag","user":{"login":"codedealer","id":4258136,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4258136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer","html_url":"https://github.com/codedealer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codedealer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2015-10-24T01:15:58Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T16:29:04Z","closed_at":"2016-02-23T01:40:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**tl;dr** Cache/buffer videos pls?\n\nThat problem was skimmed on the forum a few years ago, I think. Video playback performance is poor when it comes to loops. What it does is basically skips a few frames of video hence breaking seamless transition.\nAs far as I can tell this problem is OS agnostic and has been around for a while. Can't RenPy buffer a video file? The code explicitly states that apart from audio files buffering of video is prohibited which seems to be the shatter point.\n\nI understand this may seem like insignificant feature for a visual novel engine, but it's 2015. We have rich multimedia support on so many devices. Plus looping of video files is already baked in the engine but the described flaw kind of cancels it. We have ATL for simple stuff but no gif, apng (you name it) support for rich animation so the video is the only solution. \n\nThe most basic use case of it is looping video background in the main menu — a question that pops up on the forum every now and then.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/769","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/769/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/769/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/769/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/769","id":113041681,"number":769,"title":"Dialogue window background not predicted","user":{"login":"emmeken","id":13839091,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13839091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken","html_url":"https://github.com/emmeken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emmeken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-23T15:21:43Z","updated_at":"2015-10-24T14:47:16Z","closed_at":"2015-10-24T01:09:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If different characters have different background images for the dialogue window, prediction only works for the first window.
