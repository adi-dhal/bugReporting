To do this, start the Ren'Py launcher, and choose \"Select Project\". A menu of projects will come up. Choose \"the_question\" from it. You'll be returned to the main menu, and you can now choose \"Launch\" to start _The Question_.\n\n\"Select Project\" was removed and we can choose \"The Question\" directly in \"PROJECTS:\"\n\n> You can get back to the Ren'Py demo by doing the same thing, but choosing \"demo\" instead of \"the_question\".\n\nI can't find \"demo\"\n\n> **Creating a new Project.** Create a new project by choosing \"New Project\" from the launcher. The launcher will ask you to choose a template. Choose \"template\". The launcher will then ask you for a project name. Since \"the_question\" is already taken, you should enter something different, like \"My Question\". The launcher will then ask you to choose a color theme for the project. It doesn't matter what you pick at this point, just choose something that appeals to you. You'll be returned to the top menu of the launcher with your new game chosen.\n\n\"New Project\" is renamed to \"+Create New Project\" and some steps are changed.\n\n> To try this out, go into the launcher, change to the \"My Question\" project, and pick \"Edit Script\". This will open the script files in a text editor. Choose the script.rpy file, and erase everything in it. We're starting from scratch, so you don't need what's there. Copy the example above into script.rpy, and save it.\n\n\"Edit Script\" was sepalated to some menus.\n\n> You're now ready to run this example. Go back to the launcher, and click Run. Ren'Py will start up. Notice how, without any extra work, Ren'Py has given you menus that let you load and save the game, and change various preferences. When ready, click \"Start Game\", and play through this example game.\n\n\"Run\" is renamed to \"Launch Project\"\n\n> In the Launcher, you should go to the Tools page, and pick \"Check Script (Lint)\". This will check your games for errors that may affect some users. These errors can affect users on the Mac and Linux platforms, so it's important to fix them all, even if you don't see them on your computer.\n\n\"Tools\" page was removed.\n\n> From the Tools page, click distribute.
