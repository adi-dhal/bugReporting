Right now we have to do:\nscreen blabla:\n    key \"i\" action Inventory()\n    textbutton \"Open Inventory\" action Inventory()\n\nmy idea would be simply to add a parameter to text/image/button widget like:\nkey \"XYZ\"\nor if key is not possible any other keyword like alt_key etc.\n\nThis would be useful in games since you could code them for example like the Telltale series, in which there
