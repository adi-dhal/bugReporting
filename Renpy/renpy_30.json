finished.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/369","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/369/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/369/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/369/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/369","id":34528417,"number":369,"title":"Unicode
