hej!\n\nCould you maybe add a config option to force a physical window size > screen size - 102?\n\nYes, I know I could just remove the - 102 myself. But if I wanted to, say, distribute a Ren'Py game, then I'd need to recompile _renpy.so for every platform. And thinking about pulling ffmpeg into my local Mac OS X and Windows cross-compilers fills me with dread; I have passing knowledge of the ffmpeg codebase and I fear that won't be easy. Let alone finding out how to tell cython to use the cross-compilers.\n\nI'd rather there was a more elegant solution to that problem of the window being too big to be resizable. Just clamping the size to screen size - 102 sounds like a rather hacky idea to me, to be frank...\n\nCheers\nSven\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/405","id":36972666,"number":405,"title":"Fix
