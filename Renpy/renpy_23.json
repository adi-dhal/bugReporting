Using renpy.random to get those numbers, though, resulted in some images jumping around as the screen re-rendered.  I'm not sure whether this is fixable without a major overhaul.\n\nWell, I didn't need _really_ random numbers for my application, so I decided to create a small pool at init time, where I discovered that renpy.random was set to None, probably to maintain serialization of the RNG during game run.  Understandable.  I finally imported python's random and used that.\n\nThis leads me to two suggestions:\n\n(1) Make renpy.random available at init for coder convenience, perhaps with a different salt from game time, then reset it when game is started.\n\n(2) Make new PRNG instances available at run time.  Suggested format:\n\n```\n$ pool = renpy.random.pool(<seed>)\n```\n\nIf <seed> isn't present, find a way to seed this consistently, perhaps from a hash of the file name and line #.  Then, access pool with pool.random(), pool.randint(), pool.choice().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/606","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/606/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/606/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/606/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/606","id":67030525,"number":606,"title":"Add
