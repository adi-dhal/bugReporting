in 6.99.3.404 and 6.99.1.329\n\nWhen showing a LiveComposite which contains ATL, the contained ATL objects don't seem to reset properly between show/hides.\n\nTo repro, lets start with some ATL in init. You can copy/paste this into the tutorial for ease of use.\n\n```\n    image DemoComposite = LiveComposite(\n        (266,600),\n        (0,0), \"DemoCompA\",\n        (0,0), \"DemoCompB\",\n        (0,0), \"DemoCompC\",\n        )\n\n\n    transform DemoLoop:\n        easein 0.5 alpha 1\n        easeout 0.5 alpha 0\n        0.5\n        repeat\n\n    image DemoCompA:\n            \"target1.png\"\n            alpha 0\n            DemoLoop\n\n    image DemoCompB:\n            \"target2.png\"\n            alpha 0\n            0.5\n            DemoLoop\n\n    image DemoCompC:\n            \"star.png\"\n            alpha 0\n            1.0\n            DemoLoop\n```\n\nNow, if we go into a scene and just do a normal\n\n```\n    show DemoCompA\n    show DemoCompB\n    show DemoCompC\n```\n\neverything works as expected. When we scroll back or hit the block a second time, everything remains in sync. The three images will smoothly crossfade 0.5 seconds apart.\n\nHowever, if we decide we want to use the LiveComposite with `show DemoComposite`, we will see the correct behavior the first time, but subsequent shows will be randomly out of sync. This seems to occur both when scrolling back, and when explicitly show/hide/showing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/621","id":72035101,"number":621,"title":"Slideshow doesn't work","user":{"login":"kyouryuukunn","id":1556311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1556311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn","html_url":"https://github.com/kyouryuukunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-30T01:40:12Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T02:30:21Z","closed_at":"2015-05-08T02:30:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In 6.99.3.404, \n\n1: Click ToggleSlideshow button.\n2: A next image is shown after slideshow_delay second.\n3: But, nothing happens slideshow_delay second after it is shown.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/620","id":71776843,"number":620,"title":"Update demo_imageops.rpy","user":{"login":"Nolanlemahn","id":8920847,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8920847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn","html_url":"https://github.com/Nolanlemahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nolanlemahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-04-29T04:44:04Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T01:40:52Z","closed_at":"2015-04-30T01:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/pulls/620","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/620","diff_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/620.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/620.patch"},"body":"A previous change moved \"eileen_happy\" to \"eileen happy\".

noticed that when Ren'Py shows a new screen it creates a new instance of existing screens, however, Python code accessing variables in the scope of the existing screen still refer to the old instance. This breaks things like `SetScreenVariable`.\n\nHere's a minimal test case that reproduces the issue in the latest commit on master (https://github.com/renpy/renpy/commit/40805225bd848db72135ff35a9023258aa21fc97):\n\n``` python\nscreen test1():\n    default offset = 0\n    zorder 1\n    textbutton \"Click\":\n        hovered SetScreenVariable(\"offset\", 20)\n        unhovered SetScreenVariable(\"offset\", 0)\n        action Show(\"test2\")\n        xoffset offset\n        xalign 0.5 yalign 0.5\n\nscreen test2():\n    zorder 2\n    textbutton \"Close\" action Hide(\"test2\")\n\nlabel start:\n    show screen test\n    \"...\"\n```\n\nTo reproduce it:\n- Hover the button in the test1 screen, the offset variable should affect the button's position;\n- Click the button in the test1 screen;\n- Hover the button in the test1 screen, the offset variable does not affect the button's position anymore;\n- Hide the test2 screen;\n- Hover the button in the test1 screen, the offset variable still does not affect the button's
