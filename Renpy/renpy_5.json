to 6.99.12.3.2123 from (somewhere in the region of; sorry I couldn't be more specific) 6.99.8, most likely sometime after that, has introduced a buggy change in behaviour regarding screens and saving/loading a game. Namely, if the game is saved on a say statement immediately following the hiding of a screen, upon loading the screen may be briefly visible and re-play any 'on hide' animations, sometimes multiple times, or maybe even remain stuck on the screen. This has been noted to happen in two different scenarios so far:\r\n\r\n1) Calling a screen (A) which uses another (B). B is modal and has actions to Return(), thus resuming dialogue. On \"hide\", B has some disappearing animations for its constituents and also plays a sound. If the game is saved and loaded on the statement immediately afterwards, these disappearing animations replay and the sound is played 5-6 times rapidly.\r\n\r\n2) A 'pause menu' style screen is modal and adds a translucent black image across the screen, with an imagemap on top (saving is done from here). If the menu is opened, closed, and then reopened again in order to save (on the same say statement), reloading the game causes the modal translucent background to be visible (the imagemap is not, but the modality still prevents dismissal). From what I can tell, the behaviour of this is less consistent than above: reloading the slot multiple times may see it not happen at all, or sometimes happen but only for a second or two.\r\n\r\nThis definitely started happening only after an update to Ren'Py, so it can't be my code - unless it's a result of deliberate engine changes I need to account for.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/1138","id":208741857,"number":1138,"title":"Possibility to mark variable for forced save","user":{"login":"alexei-osipov","id":8040900,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8040900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov","html_url":"https://github.com/alexei-osipov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexei-osipov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-02-19T19:58:21Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T01:30:43Z","closed_at":"2017-09-19T01:30:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Preface**\r\nProbably everyone who made a decent game with RenPy is aware that RenPy does not save (includes into game save file) variables that have same value. To check if value is same Renpy just checks if object is same or not via Python \"is\" operator ([see `get_changes()` in python.py](https://github.com/renpy/renpy/blob/67c893fb41089c24b6b572b10cedf26b134aff3a/renpy/python.py#L121)). That works fine for numbers and strings but anything more complex (like lists, sets, custom object) is not saved even if the object was modified.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```RenPy\r\ninit:\r\n    define inventory = ['rusty_sword']\r\nlabel add_shield:\r\n    $ inventory.append('wooden_shield')\r\n```\r\nIf you modify the list by calling `add_shield` and then try to save a game the list will not be saved because the object reference is same as before. After game load the list value will be `['rusty_sword']`.\r\n\r\nCommon workaround for this problem is to move declaration of such variables to a labels that executes after game `start`.\r\n```RenPy\r\nlabel init_variables:\r\n    $ inventory = ['rusty_sword']\r\n    return\r\nlabel add_shield:\r\n    $ inventory.append('wooden_shield')\r\nlabel start:\r\n    call init_variables\r\n    jump real_start\r\n```\r\nProblems with this workaround:\r\n- This makes game initialization sequence more complex.\r\n- This forces you to put initialization of some variables to different places. Not to the places where it's logical to define certain variable.\r\n- There is no initial value (value that is accessible before `start`). This causes issues if you plan to use something like `renpy.call_replay` (you have to reproduce initialization).\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**\r\nAdd a way to explicitly mark a variable to be included in save file.\r\nProbably the best if we had\r\n1. a keyword to mark such variables, like \"persist\"\r\n```RenPy\r\ninit:\r\n    define persist inventory = ['rusty_sword']\r\n```\r\n2. RenPy python API method. Something like `add_to_persist`:\r\n```RenPy\r\ninit:\r\n    define inventory = ['rusty_sword']\r\n    $ renpy.add_to_persist('inventory')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: keyword and method name are just examples.\r\n\r\nNote: there a way to achieve same as 2 in RenPy already via\r\n`renpy.game.log.ever_been_changed['NAME_OF_MY_VARIABLE'] = True`\r\nhowever it's not part of public API so it's kind evil.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1137","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1137/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1137/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1137/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/1137","id":208693771,"number":1137,"title":"Slow
