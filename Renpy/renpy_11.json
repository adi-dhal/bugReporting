I apologize if this has been answered (in my defense I have been searching online for hours and have not found the answer).  I have an imagebutton and would like to have data action performed when it is clicked.  I can perform other actions such as Hide and Jump with no problem, however, the SetVariable action does not appear to do anything.  \n\nI defined a variable to \"count\" thusly:\ninit python:\n    showcompletion= False\n    completion = 0\n    def display_completion():\n        if showcompletion:  \n            ui.frame() #This is optional. It adds a frame around the text.\n            ui.text(\"Completion: %d\" %completion)\n    config.overlay_functions.append(display_completion)\n\n I copied this directly from  https://www.renpy.org/wiki/renpy/doc/cookbook/Simple_Onscreen_Inventory to try to avoid issues.  \n\nAn example of my image button is:\n    screen P_tube_options00:\n        modal False\n        imagebutton:\n            xpos 0 ypos 500\n            idle \"idle.png\"\n            hover \"hover_text.png\"\n            action [Hide(\"imagebutton\")]\n        imagebutton:\n            xpos 180 ypos 180\n            idle \"blank.png\"\n            hover \"hover.png\"\n            action [Jump(\"P_tube00_description\"), SetVariable(\"completion\",completion+1), SetVariable('T_options00a',True)]\n\nI got this from https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=9412 .\n\nI have tried \"clicked\" instead of \"action\".  I have done just SetVariable(\"completion\",completion+1) alone and just SetVariable('T_options00a',True) [I then set up an if statement, if blah == True: $completion+=1] alone, however, when I do showcompletion=True or just %(completion)d, it reads 0.  If I put $completion+=1 or even SetVariable(\"completion\", completion+=1) into the imagebutton tabs, I get an error.  \n\nI am sure this is very simple and I very sorry for wasting your time, but the help is greatly appreciated.  \n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4814","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"83DA:366F:1549B8:2C8AB2:59D7D096","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=12>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=43>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=10>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ad8eb11214fa2f89279c9118dd286a64\"","status":"200 OK"}}
