say I have a non standard Mac but rather custom. That said the driver used with graphics card is official delivered by Apple and so far I have had no other problems even in heavy 3D games. But more recent Ren'Py games published on Steam crash right after intro sequence without leaving anything in logs or any meaningful error message. By trial and error I found that the problem is in OpenGL renderer, but if it is turned off these games start to look [like this](https://imgur.com/0dZZKu6). I continued my search and found that disabling `gl_resize` setting while OpenGL is enabled solves my problem. Next I tried to change modes and resolution and found that games crash only on some resolutions and never in fullscreen.\n\nWhen they crash:\n[**Sunrider log.txt**](https://gist.github.com/subcake/91e0e4a3a6ec35c60f2c) (Ren'Py 6.18.1.670)\n[**Shan Gui log.txt**](https://gist.github.com/subcake/2326ad747a87b80f54bf) (Ren'Py 6.18.2.729)\n\nWhen they don't (Dock is hidden, no other changes):\n[**Sunrider log.txt**](https://gist.github.com/subcake/c06c9e9c2d33709ed894) (Ren'Py 6.18.1.670)\n[**Shan Gui log.txt**](https://gist.github.com/subcake/ea9eb10327a93cd1a8fc) (Ren'Py 6.18.2.729)\n\nMac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/485","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/485/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/485/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/485/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/485","id":46599391,"number":485,"title":"Occasional visual artifacts scaling Frame()s in OpenGL","user":{"login":"SpikyCaterpillar","id":4422093,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4422093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar","html_url":"https://github.com/SpikyCaterpillar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikyCaterpillar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-10-23T08:18:23Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T04:15:46Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T04:15:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm seeing occasional glitches where the corners of a Frame are rendered at a slightly different size than the body at some window sizes.

was playing around with the new functions added in https://github.com/renpy/renpy/commit/a190738a242404e13e12c95019552938a903bc3b  and I realized that if I open a save file from a different location than it was saved in things can go wrong. see this traceback:\n\n```\nI'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.\n\nWhile running game code:\n  File \"renpy/common/00console.rpy\", line 608, in

E:\\dropbox\\renpy-6.14.1-sdk\\Sunrider Battle alpha/game/shipmap.rpy'  is NOT the path the game is located that I'm currently running! I actually have a local copy of the game at 'D:\\renpy\\ new folder\\sunrider beta 6' and that's where I'm running the game and trying to load this save. the save file was almost certainly created at that location, however. also, that's the location ren'py has been pointed to as the 'project folder' for some time.\n\nI've tried replicating this with a new test project by changing the 'project folder', making a new project, making a save, moving the test project to inside the renpy folder and running it there. however, it loads fine. the inconsistency of this issue is probably the strangest thing about it.\n\nI don't even understand where this elaborate tuple of (path, int,int) comes from and why it is used instead of a regular string to reference a label. while experimenting I've seen regular strings in the return stack a number of times, so I know that is how usually things work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/464","id":43837106,"number":464,"title":"Expose

I still don't know what caused this in the first place though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/461","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/461/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/461/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/461/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/461","id":43483935,"number":461,"title":"Update Spanish template","user":{"login":"xavi-mat","id":1102677,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1102677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat","html_url":"https://github.com/xavi-mat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-22T13:36:02Z","updated_at":"2014-09-22T14:02:03Z","closed_at":"2014-09-22T14:02:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/pulls/461","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/461","diff_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/461.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/461.patch"},"body":"Updated options.rpy (English comments deleted: redundant)\nUpdated screens.rpy (from the English template, with arguments in the screens definitions)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/460","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/460/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/460/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/460/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/460","id":43329641,"number":460,"title":"Launcher mismatch","user":{"login":"darkleo","id":255780,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/255780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo","html_url":"https://github.com/darkleo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkleo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-21T08:06:28Z","updated_at":"2014-09-21T21:37:30Z","closed_at":"2014-09-21T21:37:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\n\nI've tracked down a problem I encounter in various Ren'Py games, especially annoying when it affects games sold through Steam.\nSo the problem is simple: when I try to launch for example Heileen 1, Bionic Heart or Rising Angels: Reborn (I presume I'd get the same with all the other renpy games on steam that I don't own), it opens the default launcher instead of the game (I mean this screen http://www.renpy.org/doc/html/_images/launcher.png).\n\nFor the system specifics, I run archlinux x64 and have renpy installed.\n\nA simple solution is to unset the environmental variable RENPY_BASE (which is set to \"/usr/share/renpy/\" on my machine), and the games launch correctly, as it don't find my version of renpy anymore.\nA fix would be to remove the line 101 \"renpy_base = os.environ.get('RENPY_BASE', renpy_base)\" in renpy.py. I don't really understand that line anyway: why looking for a (possibly incompatible) version of renpy instead of using the version shipped with the game? As far as I know the shipped version could have been modified for the purpose of the game.\n\nADD: I just tried to download the demo of http://www.winterwolves.com/planetstronghold.htm and got the same problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/459","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/459/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/459/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/459/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/459","id":43319048,"number":459,"title":"Updated translations in front_page.rpy.","user":{"login":"tlm-2501","id":462484,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/462484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501","html_url":"https://github.com/tlm-2501","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlm-2501/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-20T20:36:05Z","updated_at":"2014-10-04T03:00:07Z","closed_at":"2014-10-04T03:00:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/pulls/459","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/459","diff_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/459.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/459.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/458","id":43310555,"number":458,"title":"minimum size ain't available for viewport?","user":{"login":"DoumanAsh","id":5676053,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5676053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh","html_url":"https://github.com/DoumanAsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-20T13:45:34Z","updated_at":"2015-02-07T00:00:28Z","closed_at":"2015-02-07T00:00:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"u'xminimum' is not a keyword argument or valid child for the viewport statement.\n    xminimum 400\n\nSame for (y)minimum\n\nSince maximum works just fine i guess minimum should too?
