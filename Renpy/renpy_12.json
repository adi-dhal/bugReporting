I can see it slightly when running games in more standard resolutions (e.g. the tutorial game) but when the game resolution is lowered it really highlights that the movement isn't smooth and scrolling can become quite eratic. Using warpers other than 'linear' masks the problem, as does using a very slow or very fast scrolling speed.\n\nI've made a test project which shows the problem for me across all my systems (Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS), here is the download link:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/b60riwqeaosc4z0/ScrollingTest.zip?dl=1\n\nI'm guessing that it's down to a high variance in the time between frames. Is there any debug output that would show timing per frame (other than briefly during video initialisation), and is it possible that scrolling performance could be improved by having an optional smoothing of delta time (something similar to [this](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/time-smoothdeltatime.10253/))?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/934","id":152895160,"number":934,"title":"Build

proposed here: https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=38122\n\n> When the script is heavy-choice, amount of labels can soon get unmanageable. I think the usual way to avoid name collisions is to use something like \"chapter1_episode1_choice1\", but it is ugly, verbose and still doesn't guarantee avoidance of collisions, especially when using third-party code.\n> \n> To resolve this problem i propose introducing 'local' labels, which can have identical names inside different 'global' labels. Here's how it works:\n> \n> ``` renpy\n> label global_label:             # normal label, nothing changed for its behaviour\n>   \"...\"\n> label .a:                       # local label fully identified as global_label.a\n>   \"...\"\n>   jump .a                       # local jump, resolved to global_label.a\n> \n> label another_global_label:\n>   \"...\"\n> label .a:                       # another_global_label.a\n>   jump global_label.a\n> ```\n> \n> Syntax-wise, it's fully backwards compatible since currently label names cannot contain dot and thus all existing labels are considered global with this change.\n> \n> It is also possible to expand this idea to have no nesting limit (i.e. making possible to have label a.b.c.d and jump to it inside a.b.c scope by simply \"jump ...d\")\n> \n> I also found out that it is currently possible to 'nest' labels using indentation, but it doesn't protect from name collisions. It is possible to implement the same mechanism with such nested labels, but since it uses old syntax, it can cause problems with existing code. Also, it is more visual which can sometimes be good, but can also be bad when you prefer all statements to be on same indentation level.\n\nWhile waiting for comments, i finished implementing it anyway and so making this pr for more specific discussion. If this is going to be accepted, i'll mention this in docs as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/915/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/915/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/915","id":149427737,"number":915,"title":"use

This will happen also in the Tutorial game, making me unable to read what the tutorial topic is.  I've tried reinstalling and refreshing, but nothing seems to make this bug go away!  Any suggestions as to what I can do?  I've attached screenshots of the bug in action.\n![renpybug_languages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18447937/14503605/e125f3d4-017e-11e6-9202-cf0f7ffab7f9.png)\n![renpybug_projects](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18447937/14503603/e11f66b8-017e-11e6-838a-9f7251132257.png)\n![renpybug_themes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18447937/14503602/e11e971a-017e-11e6-97b5-95e2db9ea126.png)\n![renpybug_tutorialgame](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18447937/14503604/e124aad8-017e-11e6-924c-7a9ad8c00995.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/908","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/908/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/908/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/908/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/908","id":148089262,"number":908,"title":"in the latest nightly doesn't save the game after switching language","user":{"login":"Zateinik","id":18444678,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18444678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik","html_url":"https://github.com/Zateinik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zateinik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-13T14:59:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T03:54:08Z","closed_at":"2016-04-15T03:54:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Error when save the game after switching language\n\n[code]\nI'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.\n\nWhile running game code:\n  File \"renpy/common/00action_file.rpy\", line 357, in **call**\n    renpy.save(fn, extra_info=save_name)\nPicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'module'>: attribute lookup **builtin**.module failed\n\n-- Full Traceback ------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull traceback:\n  File \"renpy/common/_layout/screen_load_save.rpym\", line 35, in script\n    $ ui.interact()\n  File \"C:\\Renpy\\renpy\\ast.py\", line 806, in execute\n    renpy.python.py_exec_bytecode(self.code.bytecode, self.hide, store=self.store)\n  File \"C:\\Renpy\\renpy\\python.py\", line 1591, in py_exec_bytecode\n    exec bytecode in globals, locals\n  File \"renpy/common/_layout/screen_load_save.rpym\", line 35, in <module>\n    $ ui.interact()\n  File \"C:\\Renpy\\renpy\\ui.py\", line 277, in interact\n    rv = renpy.game.interface.interact(roll_forward=roll_forward, *_kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Renpy\\renpy\\display\\core.py\", line 2428, in interact\n    repeat, rv = self.interact_core(preloads=preloads, *_kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Renpy\\renpy\\display\\core.py\", line 3104, in interact_core\n    rv = root_widget.event(ev, x, y, 0)\n  File \"C:\\Renpy\\renpy\\display\\layout.py\", line 905, in event\n    rv = i.event(ev, x -
