And we can use those plugins freely to make some advanced works. Like, I can use dynamic character images in the game, or multiple layers background, encrypt game scripts, even I can put a sub engine in it. These are not available in the original engine.\nLook back to Ren'py, it contains complex source codes and some advanced functions, but I still feel not enough. Sometimes I want to create a Japanese-styled game, but Ren'py couldn't give me the things I want, or I have to look through a lot of instructions then understand how to use them. If we need to add some new things to engine, we still have to modify the source code rather than just realize them by put plugins inside my project.\nI think Ren'py will be better if one day it can supports customize plugins. Engine just have to provide an interface and everyone can write their own plugins for it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/685","id":94848790,"number":685,"title":"Music&Sound
