It reads as follows:\n\n```\nCould not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>\nConsider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]\n```\n\nThis variable is indeed unset, but none of my other python \nprograms complain about it, because my python install is in the \ndefault search path. I have **Katawa Shoujo** (which uses \n**Ren'Py  6.10.2e**) on this same computer, and there is no \nerror when I run it, implying that it may be an issue specific to\nthis release.\n\nI am not familiar with how the Ren'Py version and its renpython \ninteract with the shell, but the error clutters up my log files and \nstderr. It also persists through a release, which I was able to test \nby \"Building Distributions\" of the tutorial and the question. Both \nof these, when packaged for distribution for Linux x86, throw \nthis warning upon execution.\n\nThis makes distribution and development using this version of \nthe SDK or nightly build ugly. It does not, however, break \nanything. Google, and the Forums on Lemma, both do not have \nany information on the subject. In other projects (which do not \nhave a dedicated version of python, requiring a system version \ninstead) this issue is usually due to nonstandard library \ninstallation... and the variable being unset.\n\nI am still looking for a solution, and was wondering if this is a \nknown issue.

using a transparent png image for the Yes/No Prompt background, it will overlap the previous background when the prompt appears except when pressing the X button of the window to exit the game in a

from the following version onward.\n\nImages attached:\n![bug yesno prompt 1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6564457/2059221/e90b13d4-8b9e-11e3-8b22-82e344069456.png)\n![bug yesno prompt

In the main menu, press the \"Quit\" button to see how the gray.png image overlaps with the background when the yes/no prompt appears.\n2. In the main menu again, press the \"X\" in the corner of the window to exit the game. Notice how when the yes/no prompt appears the menu background is removed.\n3. Press \"Start Game\", and then press the \"X\" in the corner of the window to exit the game.

When a line's width is too  long to fit in the window, it's automatically broken into multiple lines  displayed one below the other.\nI propose a similar system that would make sure blocks don't bleed off  the bottom of the screen the way they currently do. It's very  frustrating (and at times difficult to notice) when a line (or even  worse, a single word) is never displayed because RenPy renders it  outside of the window.\nHaving RenPy catch that and do an nvl-clear before the overflowing block  would be very convenient. Even if it is not desired behaviour, it will  at least be obvious that there's an overflow and then the writer will  fix it by doing an explicit nvl-clear where he wants it.\n\n---\n\nAn alternative way to address this issue would be scrolling rather than  doing an nvl-clear. This will help the reading flow more naturally. I  personally find animated scrolling more appealing, but: On the one hand,  non-animated scrolling is easier to implement and is less annoying for  the reader on slow scrolling speeds, but on the other hand,  animated-scrolling feels more \"polished\", doesn't bother the user on  fast scrolling speeds, and in fact helps the reader keep track of where  he is in the text.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/282","id":26690943,"number":282,"title":"Add missing lines linesin Spanish template and minor typos","user":{"login":"xavi-mat","id":1102677,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1102677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat","html_url":"https://github.com/xavi-mat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-01-31T16:06:57Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T05:58:36Z","closed_at":"2014-02-03T08:45:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/pulls/282","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/282","diff_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/282.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/282.patch"},"body":"(I'm not sure if this is the correct way to do this.
