I went trolling around in the source as installed on my machine and found several references to `keyboard_focus`. They looked to be the same as what's on Github and the release notes mention that this was added in 6.18.2. I'm not sure what else to check to see why it won't work on my machine.\n\nAny advice?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/508","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/508/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/508/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/508/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/508","id":51003824,"number":508,"title":"Why action Return(None) returns True?","user":{"login":"xavi-mat","id":1102677,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1102677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat","html_url":"https://github.com/xavi-mat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavi-mat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-12-04T17:30:24Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T01:41:17Z","closed_at":"2014-12-27T10:43:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tried:\n\n```\nlabel start:\n    call screen testing\n    $ a = _return\n    \"[_return] [a]\"\n    return\n\nscreen testing():\n    textbutton \"Press HERE\" action Return(None) align (.5,.5)\n```\n\nGot \"True\" in \"_return\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/507","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/507/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/507/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/507/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/507","id":50909270,"number":507,"title":"Unhovered event not being called","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-12-03T23:40:08Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T23:57:25Z","closed_at":"2015-04-19T23:57:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We have a map screen that shows different options when you hover over a location. These options appear in a modal to keep from conflicting with the map background, and we use a mousearea with a focus mask to tell when the user moves their mouse outside of the location. When they do, we hide the options so they can hover over other locations.\n\nThis works perfectly when mouse movement is slow, however when mouse movement is quick, the unhovered event is often not called, forcing the options menu to remain open until the user re-enters and re-exits the mousearea.\n\nA commit where this problem can be viewed is here: https://github.com/Dischan/Dysfunctional-Systems-Ep2/tree/map_debug. To test, just start the game, go to New Story, test, and Show Map. There's no real way to reliably reproduce the bug, however if you move your mouse around the map rapidly you should notice it. It might be easier to trigger if the resolution is set to 576p.\n\nThe relevant code is located in game/ui_script/map/map_ui.rpy.

am not sure if the function is intended to be supported, but I would like to be able to use a class member as a dictionary index inside of a say statement. I tried a few ways, but none of them work, and the most puzzling result is the double-bracketed one, which appears to drop an end-bracket in its interpretation. This is a complete script file that shows the problem I am having:\n\n```\ninit python:\n    class key_class:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.string = \"one\"\n\n    d = {\"one\":\"the first item\"}\n    c = key_class()\n\nlabel start:\n    #\"the first item is [d[one]]\" #the first item is the first item\n    #\"the first item is [d['one']]\" #KeyError: u\"'one'\"\n    #\"the first item is [d[c.string]]\" #KeyError: u'c.string'\n    \"the first item is [d[[c.string]]]\" #KeyError: u'[c.string'\n\n    return\n```\n\nIs it possible to do this, or is the ideal method to set temporary variables?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/498","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/498/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/498/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/498/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/498","id":49482850,"number":498,"title":"Let
