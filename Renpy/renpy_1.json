Another issue I found in the latest nightly (6.99.13.2733): when using \"voice sustain\", voice clips replay from the beginning. I suspect it's related to [this recent commit](https://github.com/renpy/renpy/commit/c94d223b05fd8496898181d097c82f8e7d892d7a).\r\n\r\nBelow is a short example to demonstrate (\"line.ogg\" is in the attached ZIP). \r\n[line.ogg.zip](https://github.com/renpy/renpy/files/1287123/line.ogg.zip)\r\n\r\nIf you click to advance the text before the voice clip has finished playing, the voice clip will restart from the beginning when you reach the next line of text (right after \"voice sustain\"). I would expect the voice clip to continue playing without restarting, which is what it has done in the past.\r\n```\r\ndefine e = Character(\"Eileen\") #, what_slow_cps=0)\r\n\r\nlabel start:\r\n    scene bg room\r\n    voice \"line.ogg\"\r\n    e \"Once upon a time...\"\r\n    voice sustain\r\n    e \"...or what just seems like a very long time ago...\"\r\n    voice sustain\r\n    e \"...my father told me stories about the mermaids.\"\r\n    return\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information, and thanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/1244","id":255854795,"number":1244,"title":"Translation update for custom resolution and russian","user":{"login":"Ria-kon","id":24704640,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/24704640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon","html_url":"https://github.com/Ria-kon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ria-kon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-07T08:24:58Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T20:56:22Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T20:56:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/pulls/1244","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/1244","diff_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/1244.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/1244.patch"},"body":"Main feature: Custom resolution now translatable in launcher.\r\n\r\nOther is just update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1243","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1243/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1243/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1243/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/1243","id":255840865,"number":1243,"title":"Screen transform problem related to atl_st_offset","user":{"login":"arowana-vx","id":31723553,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31723553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx","html_url":"https://github.com/arowana-vx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arowana-vx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-07T07:28:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T03:17:42Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T02:28:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the latest nightly (6.99.13.2717), some of my screen animations are acting weirdly.
