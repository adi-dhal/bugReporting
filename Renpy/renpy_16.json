DynamicImage, we can define images like:\n\n<code>\nimage eileen = \"eileen [mood]\"\n</code>\n\nThe problem is, this means manually updating the variable used, which can be messy and repetitive.\n\n<code>\nlabel start:\n  $ mood = 'happy'\n  eileen \"I'm happy!\"\n  $ mood = 'angry'\n  eileen \"I'm angry!\"\n  $ mood = 'happy'\n  eileen \"I'm happy again!\"\n  $ mood = 'angry'\n  eileen \"Nope, still angry!\"\n</code>\n\nUsually in renpy, we'd be able to use who arguments to change images.\n\n<code>\nlabel start:\n  eileen happy \"I'm happy!\"\n  eileen angry \"I'm angry!\"\n  eileen happy \"I'm happy again!\"\n  eileen angry \"Nope, still angry!\"\n</code>\n\nNaturally this won't work with dynamic images, since the arguments are mapped to variables which need updating.\n\nMy idea to overcome this is to include optional indices in the dynamic image statement, resolving them from last to first.\n\n<code>\nimage eileen = \"eileen [0:pose] [1:mood]\"\n\nlabel start:\n  $pose = 'standing'\n  eileen happy \"I'm happy!\" #happy maps to 1, the last index, and pose is already set\n  eileen standing sad \"...Not.\" #sad maps to 1, and standing maps to 0\n</code>\n\nThis would retain compatibility with existing dynamic images, but also allow for more flexibility going forward, allowing someone to effectively use one \"image\" statement per character while also allowing for the traditional dialogue image swapping syntax.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/808","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/808/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/808/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/808/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/808","id":123049875,"number":808,"title":"Small
