While I was able to run the game the first time (my window manager went nuts and I had to control c it) after that I get the following error in the console:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/jwscoggins/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Sakura Spirit/Sakura Spirit.py\", line 164, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/home/jwscoggins/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Sakura Spirit/Sakura Spirit.py\", line 161, in main\n    renpy.bootstrap.bootstrap(renpy_base)\n  File \"/home/jwscoggins/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Sakura Spirit/renpy/bootstrap.py\", line 261, in bootstrap\n    renpy.import_all()\n  File \"/home/jwscoggins/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Sakura Spirit/renpy/**init**.py\", line 144, in import_all\n    import renpy.style #@UnresolvedImport\nImportError: No module named style\nGame removed: AppID 313740 \"Sakura Spirit\", ProcID 25371\n\nSince I wanted to be able to tinker, I downloaded the renpy-sdk-6.17.3 (same version as Sakura Spirit runs) and was treated to the same error when I ran ./renpy.sh. \n\nTweaking that shell script so x86_64 still uses the i686 version actually yielded success. \nSo running lib/linux-x86_64/python yielded a shell which was identical to my system version of python. So it seems that the 64-bit version shipped with the sdk is not being used and the system version is. \n\nDo you have any ideas how to change this? I'm not even sure what to search Google for.\n\nMy system is: \n- Gentoo Linux amd64\n- Python 2.7.6 (built with gcc 4.8.2), Python 3.2.0, Python 3.3.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4797","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"8746:366E:E7A19:1FC814:59D7D0C8","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=29>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=43>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=27>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d977e1f3da24fe6a8c24b3faa8ebe0f2\"","status":"200 OK"}}
